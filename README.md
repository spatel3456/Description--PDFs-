# Description--PDFs-
This is a "public" set repository with only the description of the acutal "PDFs" repository, which is set "private".


This repository goes with the research work I did with a faculty in Texas A&M as a quick project to get into research.

As part of this project, we look at Adobe Acrobat, program by Oracle that lets you code into a PDF page. Acrobat's main usage in normal lives comes with creating text pages, similar to notepad/ Microsoft Word, that are created/used for the only purpose of refering to text. A sophisticated and giant program (over 10's of millions of lines of code in the program) that is no better than a pen and paper. 

However, the program contains many embedded functions (coding language similar to JavaScript), that can be used for a plethora of purposes. We looked at link handling, data management, and data leakage in the 3 months we spent together. 

To learn about the project, click on my personal page (main link on this GitHub account) and find my email-address to contact me.
